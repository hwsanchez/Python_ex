#this is a Python list:
#List constants are surrounded by square brackets and
#the elements are separated by commas

friends = ['Benni', 'Matthias', 'John', 'Nando']

#Lists and definite loops:

for friend in friends :
    print('Hello', friend)
print('done!')

#Lists are mutable, ex:

friends[2] = 'Cesar'
print(friends[2])
print(friends[0])
